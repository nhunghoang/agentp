GWAS  REGENIE wrapper for genome-wide association scans
      Orchestrates step-1/step-2 runs per chromosome and consolidates outputs.

   obj = GWAS(project)

   Syntax:
       obj.run(phens, overwrite=False, cleanup=True, num_threads=1)

   Description:
       The GWAS class wraps REGENIE to run GWAS for one or more phenotypes
       using chromosome-specific BGEN inputs. It:
         • Validates phenotype files from the provided Project and skips
           phenotypes that already have results (unless overwrite=True).
         • Builds a temporary multi-phenotype file and runs REGENIE
           step 1 and step 2 for chromosomes 1..22 (parallelizable).
         • Concatenates per-chromosome step-2 outputs into one result
           file per phenotype and reformats to CSV with a computed PVAL.
         • Optionally deletes temporary files on success.

       Requirements (provided by the Project object):
         • Genotypes directory with c{chrom}.bgen / c{chrom}.sample
         • Covariates file path
         • Phenotype file lookup via project.get_phenotype_file(name)
         • Output directory via project.set_gwas_paths()

   Inputs:
       project              Project object supplying paths and I/O helpers.
                            Used in the constructor.

       phens                String or list[str]. Phenotype name(s) as known to
                            the Project (each must resolve to a tab-separated
                            file indexed by FID, IID).

       overwrite            Logical scalar (default False). Recompute GWAS
                            even if a result file already exists.

       cleanup              Logical scalar (default True). Remove temporary
                            REGENIE outputs and intermediate phenotype file.

       num_threads          Positive integer (default 1). Number of worker
                            processes used to parallelize per-chromosome runs.

   Outputs:
       Files (written under the Project’s GWAS output directory):
         • <phen>.regenie            Final CSV per phenotype (step-2 results),
                                      with PVAL computed from LOG10P and
                                      standard REGENIE columns (ID→SNP, etc.).
         • tmp/*                     Intermediate step-1/step-2 files per chr
                                      (removed if cleanup=True).

       Return value:
         • None. Progress and warnings are printed to stdout.
