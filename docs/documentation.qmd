# Overview

This quick-start guide shows how to build and run the AGENT-P Docker image and execute the bundled example.

# Build the Image
```
cd dev_agentp
docker build -t agentp-img .
```

A successful build ends with:
=> naming to docker.io/library/agentp-img:latest

# Run the Container
```
docker run -it agentp-img /bin/bash
```

# Verify Brace Expansion
```
sh -c 'echo {2..4}'
```
expected output: 2 3 4

# Run the Example Code
```
cd /usr/home/example
bash -lc 'python run_example.py'
```

### A successfull running will create example_project, preprocesses genotypes per chromosome with QC, predicts GREX and runs sTWAS/iTWAS, performs GWAS for hippocampus_volume, and saves all results under the project directory.
